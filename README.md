# Forge Gameplay Framework
## A gameplay framework for developing games using C#.

Forge is an engine-agnostic gameplay framework designed for building robust game systems in C#. Inspired by Unreal Engine's Gameplay Ability System (GAS), Forge provides a centralized and controlled approach to managing attributes, effects, tags, and cues in your games.

The framework eliminates the need to rebuild status systems for every game project by offering a flexible, data-driven architecture that works seamlessly with both Unity and Godot engines. With Forge, all attribute changes are handled through effects, ensuring organized and maintainable code even in complex gameplay scenarios.

## Architecture Overview

Forge is built around five core systems that work together to provide comprehensive gameplay functionality:

### Core Components

- **Attributes**: Centralized attribute management with min/max values and controlled modifications
- **Effects**: Data-driven system for applying temporary or permanent changes to entities
- **Tags**: Hierarchical tagging system for entity classification and effect targeting
- **Cues**: Visual and audio feedback system with multiplayer replication support
- **Executions**: Custom logic execution within the effects pipeline

### Entity System

Every game object that uses Forge implements the `IForgeEntity` interface, providing:
- `EntityAttributes` - Manages all attributes and attribute sets
- `EntityTags` - Handles base and modifier tags with automatic inheritance
- `EffectsManager` - Controls effect application, stacking, and lifecycle

### Effects Pipeline

Effects support multiple application types:
- **Instant Effects**: Execute immediately and modify attributes
- **Duration Effects**: Apply over time with automatic cleanup
- **Periodic Effects**: Execute at regular intervals during their lifetime
- **Stackable Effects**: Controls multiple instances with configurable stacking rules

## Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress** - This project is currently under active development and not ready for production use.

### Current Features ‚úÖ

- **Tags System**: Complete hierarchical tag system with inheritance
- **Attributes System**: Full attribute management with modifiers and overrides
- **Effects System**: Comprehensive effect application with stacking support
- **Cues System**: Visual feedback system for effect application/removal
- **Executions**: Custom effect logic execution

### Planned Features üöß

- **Abilities System**: Complete ability system similar to GAS abilities
- **Multiplayer Support**: Network replication for all systems
- **Events System**: Gameplay event handling and propagation

### Known Limitations

- Abilities system not yet implemented
- No multiplayer/networking support currently
- Events system pending implementation
