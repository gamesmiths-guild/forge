# Forge Gameplay Framework

A gameplay framework for developing games using C#.

Forge is an engine-agnostic gameplay framework designed for building robust game systems in C#. Inspired by Unreal Engine's Gameplay Ability System (GAS), Forge provides a centralized and controlled approach to managing attributes, effects, tags, and cues in your games.

The framework eliminates the need to rebuild status systems for every game project by offering a flexible, data-driven architecture that works seamlessly with Unity, Godot, and other C#-compatible engines. With Forge, all attribute changes are handled through effects, ensuring organized and maintainable code even in complex gameplay scenarios.

## Architecture Overview

Forge is built around four core systems that work together to provide comprehensive gameplay functionality:

### Core Systems

- **[Attributes](docs/attributes.md)**: Centralized attribute management with min/max values, channels, and controlled modifications.
- **[Effects](docs/effects/README.md)**: Data-driven system for applying temporary or permanent changes to entities.
- **[Tags](docs/tags.md)**: Hierarchical tagging system for entity classification and effect targeting.
- **[Cues](docs/cues.md)**: Visual and audio feedback system that bridges gameplay with presentation.

### Entity Integration

Every game object that uses Forge implements the `IForgeEntity` interface, providing:

- `EntityAttributes` - Manages all attributes and attribute sets.
- `EntityTags` - Handles base and modifier tags with automatic inheritance.
- `EffectsManager` - Controls effect application, stacking, and lifecycle.

### Advanced Features

Forge supports a variety of gameplay mechanics through specialized subsystems:

- **[Effect Duration](duration.md)**: Control how long effects remain active.
- **[Effect Stacking](stacking.md)**: Configure how multiple instances of effects combine.
- **[Periodic Effects](periodic.md)**: Create effects that execute repeatedly on a schedule.
- **[Modifiers](modifiers.md)**: Define how effects change attribute values.
- **[Effect Components](components.md)**: Extend effects with custom behaviors.
- **[Custom Calculators](calculators.md)**: Flexible logic execution within the effects pipeline.

## Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress** - This project is currently under active development and not ready for production use.
